  Umuganda is a national holiday in Rwanda taking place on the
  last Saturday of every month for mandatory nationwide community
  service from 08:00 to 11:00. Participation in umuganda is required by law, 
  and failure to participate can result in a fine. 
  The program was most recently re-established in 2009,
  and has resulted in a notable improvement in the cleanliness of Rwanda.

  In the 20th century, Rwandans were recorded as being required to work for their 
  community leader twice a week, while the Belgians encouraged "umuganda" as a way of 
  life.[3] In the run-up to the Rwandan genocide, weekly umuganda meetings were
  successfully used by Hutu elites to mobilise Hutu civilians for genocide.[4] 
  As part of Rwanda's reconstruction efforts after the genocide, President Paul Kagame
  mandated that every last Saturday of the month would be known as "umunsi wâ€™umuganda" 
  or "contribution made by the community", during which all traffic would be stopped for 
  three hours in the morning in order for Rwandans to clean up the war-torn capital.[3]
  Umuganda as it exists presently was instituted in 2009. It is now regarded as a day 
  of community clean-up. [2][5] Inspired by the success of Umuganda in Rwanda,
  the Mayor of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba introduced a volunteer cleanup programme 
  called A Re Sebetseng in August 2017.[6] The United Nations Mission in South Sudan 
  (UNMISS) instituted a similar program in South Sudan in June 2019.[7]
